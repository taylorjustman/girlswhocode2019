	<h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
		<p>Siberian, or commonly known as Amur, tigers primarily reside in Russia, but can also be seen throughout China and North Korea.

These fierce predators feast on red deer, manchurian elk and red deer, to name a few.</p>

<h4>Misconceptions about tigers</h4>
			<li>"White tigers are a species! They should be conserved!" --- White tigers are actually not a completely separate species, but are rather a genetic variant to Bengal tigers. These rare creatures gain their snow-white pelts as the result of inbreeding, whether it's father and daughter or mother and son. This severe manipulation of the gene pool produces offspring bearing recessive genes, such as a snow-white pelt, but also many health-deteriorating concerns like cleft palates, mental impairments and crossed eyes.</li>
			<li>"Tigers don't like water." --- Tigers don't mind the water and are in fact excellent swimmers. They swim large distances if it's needed to catch prey.</li>
			<li>"Tigers can purr!" --- The only big cat that can purr and meow is the cougar, as known as mountain lions, panthers, etc. Tigers can, however, chuff and roar.</li>
